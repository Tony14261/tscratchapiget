A library can get scratch's api

This project gets the scratch api. Everything in this project code by me (except some needed library). Big credit to TimMcCool(Scratcher) for example codes.

This can do:
    User features(v0.2.5):
        - Get a user unread-message-count ```message_count('[user]')```     EX: ```message_count('TimMcCool')```
        - Get a user id ```user_id('[user]')```     EX: ```user_id('griffpatch')```
        - Get if a user is a scratchteam ```user_scratchteam('ScratchCat')```#Return 'True'
        - Get user join date ```user_join('[user]')```     EX: ```user_join('Will_Wam')```#Return '2013-11-25T19:52:29.000Z'
        - Get a user pfp(link) ```user_pfp_link('[user]')```     EX: ```user_pfp_link('Scratch_Tony_14261')```          +Bonus Feature: Open that pfp link in browser. Change that to ```user_pfp_link_open('[Username]')```
        - Get user About-Me section ```user_aboutme('[user]')``` EX: ```user_aboutme('WazzoTV')```
        - Get user What-I'm-Working-On section ```user_wiwo('[username]')```     EX: ```user_wiwo('ceebee')```
        - Get user country ```user_country(['user]')```     EX: ```user_country(['')```
        - Get user follower count ```user_followers('[user]')```     Ex: ```user_followers('sharkyshar')```
        - Get user following count ```user_following('[user]')```     EX: ```user_followers('atomicmagicnumber')```
